## Rights

## The Right to Encrypt

- Users are free to encrypt any data or information with any algorithm
- Users cannot be compelled to share keys with a third party, or use a backdoored algorithm

### Rationale

Encryption is the fundamental backbone of the modern Web. It allows for myriad use cases including secure communication, online banking and e-commerce, and cryptocurrency. Documents leaked by whistleblowers have demonstrated that nation state actors attempt to weaken encryption standards for nefarious purposes.

## The Right to Compute

- Users are free to execute any binary or executable on their own hardware, or virtual devices under their control (e.g, Virtual Private Servers in the cloud)
- Users are not not compelled to uninstall or shutdown any program. Similarly, Users cannot be compelled to install or execute a program.

### Rationale

Centralized app stores operated by both Apple and Google have "pulled" apps previously purchased by users. Governments have passed regulation that compel infrastructure providers from operating privacy-preserving technology such as Tor exit nodes. In the future, other software will also potentially be banned - e.g., Bitcoin nodes or Urbit personal servers. Further, in the past Users have been compelled to run software against their will (e.g., South Korea browser extension)

## The Right to Repair

- Users are free to repair, modify, or upgrade their own hardware

### Rationale

Device manufacturers use restrictive terms of service and unfriendly hardware design to prevent users from repairing or modifying their devices. This practice leads to increased cost and waste.

## The Right to Portability

- Users of centralized providers such as Gmail or iCloud are free to export their data
- Users are free to import their data with other providers, or on their own self-hosted alternative

### Rationale

Centralized providers attempt to "lock in" their existing users by making it difficult to transfer to another service provider. This practice leads to consolidation and eventual monopolization, and is a key factor in the rise of Big Tech.
