## Rights

## The Right to Encrypt

- Users are free to encrypt any data or information with any algorithm
- Users cannot be compelled to share keys with a third party, or use a backdoored algorithm

### Rationale

Encryption is the fundamental backbone of the modern Web. It allows for myriad use cases including secure communication, online banking and e-commerce, and cryptocurrency. Nation state actors have attempted to covertly insert backdoors into standardized algorithms[^1], and government regulators have attempted to compel Users to install decryption devices[^2].

## The Right to Compute

- Users are free to execute any binary or executable on their own hardware, or virtual devices under their control (e.g, Virtual Private Servers in the cloud)
- Users cannot be compelled to uninstall or shutdown any program. Similarly, Users cannot be compelled to install or execute a program.

### Rationale

Centralized app stores operated by both Apple and Google have "pulled" apps previously purchased by users[^3]. Governments have passed regulation that compel infrastructure providers from operating privacy-preserving technology such as Tor or VPNs[^4]. In the future, other software will also potentially be banned - e.g., Bitcoin nodes or Urbit personal servers. Further, in the past Users have been compelled to run insecure software (for example, the South Korean government required usage of Internet Explorer with a bespoke ActiveX plugin for many years[^5].)

## The Right to Repair

- Users are free to repair, modify, or upgrade their own hardware
- Users are free to remove, uninstall, or disable trackers, keyloggers, and backdoors

### Rationale

Device manufacturers use restrictive terms of service and unfriendly hardware design to prevent users from repairing or modifying their devices. This practice leads to increased cost and waste. Further, Users can remove backdoors that are preinstalled on modern CPUs[^6] and 5G hardware[^7].

## The Right to Portability

- Users of centralized providers such as Gmail or iCloud are free to export their data
- Users are free to import their data with other providers, or on their own self-hosted alternative

### Rationale

Centralized providers attempt to "lock in" their existing users by making it difficult to transfer to another service provider. This practice leads to consolidation and eventual monopolization, and is a key factor in the rise of Big Tech.[^8]
